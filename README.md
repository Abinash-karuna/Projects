                                                   LIGHT CONTROLLING USING COMPUTER VISION
ABSTRACT
     Computer vision integration in smart lighting systems transforms user experience and energy efficiency by Utilizing cameras, image processing, and machine learning etc.. This system strives to streamline human interaction with lighting, minimize energy consumption, and elevate comfort levels by implementing intelligent, automated, and energy-efficient lighting control within indoor spaces.Smart lighting, widely adopted, incorporates advanced features like remote on/off control, enhancing user comfort and contributing to energy savings. 


EXISTING SYSTEMS
    Motion sensors are frequently used by these systems to detect human presence and initiate automatic light activation. Users can program lighting patterns in accordance with their routines using timers and scheduling features.camera infrastructure  method which is used to collect visual data by placing camers in a room or area at  strategic locations. Zigbee,  Wi-Fi  are just a few of the communication protocols that allow smart lighting systems to  connect with devices in a smart ecosystem.


PROPOSED SYSTEMS
      The system begins with the installation of a camera, such as a webcam, targeted at the region where hand gestures will be performed. This camera records real-time video of hand motions.
   
    Face Recognition Algorithms: 
        Specific face recognition algorithms are implemented within computer vision software. These algorithms are taught to identify a collection of preset face gestures.
    
    Hardware & software interconnection:
        When the computer vision program recognizes a gesture, it transmits the relevant command to the Arduino over a serial connection. This is the point at which the shift from computer vision to physical control occurs.
    
    Real-Time Responsiveness: 
        The Arduino executes orders in real time, ensuring that lighting changes are carried out quickly
